## Project 360

### Goals

Having a complete process to produce 360degree(ish) video and keep as we can cheap, open source, in one word accessible

The final result look like that

- [VRVideo](http://www.vrideo.com/)
- [Youtube 360](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzuqhhs6NWbgTzMuM09WKDQ)

Can be played on single/multiple flat screen/projector, using like on youtube and moving the view of the video with your mouse, using any VR headset (google cardboard, occulus rift,...)

### Possibilities

#### Rigs of phones

Structure with 4 or more iPhone or any other video recording system

- [Sony 360 48K](http://www.3ders.org/articles/20160113-sony-makes-worlds-first-48k-360-video-using-smartphones-and-3d-printed-rig.html)
- [Sony 360 48K](http://www.luma-id.com/2016/01/11/camera-rig-for-sony/)
- [6 Gopro 360](http://www.jonasginter.de/360-grad-video-mit-6-gopro-kameras/)
- [How to shoot, edit and upload 360 degree videos](http://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/how-to-shoot-edit-and-upload-360-degree-videos/)

Pro :

-	Less material around the phone, just a special 3d printed rig, can be modular for a smaller aperture
-	For the output video can be any recording devices, just the same for all the rig
-	Can be 2 for 90deg or 4 for 180 or 6 or more for 360deg
-	Huge definition

Cons :

-	Very powerful post processing to join all the movie together, 48K seems hard with a standard computer
-	2 main software, complex and expensive (≈700USD), no open source or any easy way found for the moment
-	Difference of lightning and color that you may can see between each phone on the boundary

#### Special lens

Special 360 lens on top of the recording system, can be a conical or sphere mirror.

Pro :

-	Something that we can adapt to phone, gopro, standard photo camera,…, just use the same lens but different mounting accessory that we can print (iphone-other case, special adapter for gopro,…)
-	Only one device instead of a rig
-	Easier software part because you don’t need to stitch all the movie together
-	Can be without post processing via special app

Cons :

-	Have to print or buy the special lens, can be expensive and not easy to get around the world
-	Less definition because of the 360deg on one device [Unwraping explanation](http://singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/panoramic-unwarping.jpg)

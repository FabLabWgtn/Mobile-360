## Project 360

### Goals

Having a complete process to produce 360degree(ish) video and keep as we can cheap, open source, in one word accessible

The final result look like that

- [VRVideo](http://www.vrideo.com/)
- [Youtube 360](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzuqhhs6NWbgTzMuM09WKDQ)

Can be played on single/multiple flat screen/projector, using like on youtube and moving the view of the video with your mouse, using any VR headset (google cardboard, occulus rift,...)

#### Conclusion (or temporary conclusion)

Multi-phone rig -> adjustable, scalable, large(50$) -> hight res(up to 48K)  -> (heavy software(1000$) or lot of time to do manualy\*) + computer power or time (with a normal computer and high res can be 10h per minute of video)

Conical Lens($$\*) -> adjustable case(50$) -> low res(with 4K we go down to 2K after processing maybe) -> no stitching -> lite software\* -> low time

\* : to be define before the next meting :
- software/method research for Multi-phone rig
- price conical lens
- Software process for conical lens

to be define at the next meting :
- the goal or final output/public of the projects

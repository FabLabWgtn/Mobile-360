### Goals

Having a complete process to produce 360degree(ish) video and keep as we can cheap, open source, in one word accessible

The final result look like that

- [VRVideo](http://www.vrideo.com/)
- [Youtube 360](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzuqhhs6NWbgTzMuM09WKDQ)

Can be played on single/multiple flat screen/projector, using like on youtube and moving the view of the video with your mouse, using any VR headset (google cardboard, occulus rift,...)

- [easy way with a smartphone(front and back camera)](http://camera360now.xyz/recored-360-degree-video-by-smartphone/)
- [State of VR for professional(a lot of useful comments)](http://stateofvr.com/)

### Conclusion (or temporary conclusion)

Multi-phone rig <b>-></b> adjustable, scalable, large(50$) <b>-></b> hight res(up to 48K) <b>-></b> (heavy software(1000$) <b>or</b> lot of time to do manualy\*) <b>and</b> (computer power <b>or</b> time (with a normal computer and high res can be 10h++ per minute of video))

Conical Lens($$\*) <b>-></b> adjustable case(50$) <b>-></b> low res(with 4K we go down to 2K after processing maybe) <b>-></b> no stitching <b>-></b> lite software\* <b>-></b> low time

\* : to be define before the next meting :

- software/method research for Multi-phone rig
- price conical lens
- Software process for conical lens

to be define at the next meting :

- the goal or final output/public of the projects

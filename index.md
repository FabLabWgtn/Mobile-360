### Goals

Having a complete process to produce 360degree(ish) video and keep as we can cheap, open source, in one word accessible

The final result look like that

- [VRVideo](http://www.vrideo.com/)
- [Youtube 360](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzuqhhs6NWbgTzMuM09WKDQ)

Can be played on single/multiple flat screen/projector, using like on youtube and moving the view of the video with your mouse, using any VR headset (google cardboard, occulus rift,...)

- [easy way with a smartphone(front and back camera)](http://camera360now.xyz/recored-360-degree-video-by-smartphone/)
- [State of VR for professional(a lot of useful comments)](http://stateofvr.com/)

### Conclusion

For the moment the best solution we use is with

- a multi-phone rig for the material
- adobe premiere and hugin for stitching the video together

We have to improve the process to replace adobe premiere with other open source tools

We wait the perfect solution for the stitching part from Facebook or Google when they finish the software part.
